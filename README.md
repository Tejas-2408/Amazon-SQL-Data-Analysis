## Amazon USA Sales Data Analysis


## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.

## **Database Setup & Design**

### **Schema Structure**

**Database and Table schema is executed using**: https://github.com/Tejas-2408/Amazon-SQL-Data-Analysis/blob/main/schemas.sql

---

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset by:
- **Removing duplicates**: Duplicates in the customer and order tables were identified and removed.
- **Handling missing values**: Null values in critical fields (e.g., customer address, payment status) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods.

---

## **Handling Null Values**

Null values were handled based on their context:
- **Customer addresses**: Missing addresses were assigned default placeholder values.
- **Payment statuses**: Orders with null payment statuses were categorized as “Pending.”
- **Shipping information**: Null return dates were left as is, as not all shipments are returned.

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance
  

## **Identifying Business Problems**

Key business problems identified:
1. Low product availability due to inconsistent restocking.
2. High return rates for specific product categories.
3. Significant delays in shipments and inconsistencies in delivery times.
4. High customer acquisition costs with a low customer retention rate.

## **Learning Outcomes**

This project enabled me to:
- Design and implement a normalized database schema.
- Clean and preprocess real-world datasets for analysis.
- Use advanced SQL techniques, including window functions, subqueries, and joins.
- Conduct in-depth business analysis using SQL.
- Optimize query performance and handle large datasets efficiently.

#### Store Procedure to validate order availability

We need to check if we have inventory for the order placed by the user and accordingly need to update the inventory after order successfully placed. Below is the Store Procedure code to check this:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE add_sales(
p_order_id INT,
p_customer_id INT,
p_seller_id INT,
p_order_item_id INT,
p_product_id INT,
p_quantity INT
)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$

DECLARE -- DECLARING VARIABLES
v_count INT;
v_price FLOAT;
v_product VARCHAR(50);

BEGIN

-- Fetching product name and price based p id entered
	SELECT 
		price, product_name
		INTO
		v_price, v_product
	FROM products
	WHERE product_id = p_product_id;
	
-- checking stock and product availability in inventory	
	SELECT 
		COUNT(*) 
		INTO
		v_count
	FROM inventory
	WHERE 
		product_id = p_product_id
		AND 
		stock >= p_quantity;
		
	IF v_count > 0 THEN
	-- add into orders and order_items table
	-- update inventory
		INSERT INTO orders(order_id, order_date, customer_id, seller_id)
		VALUES
		(p_order_id, CURRENT_DATE, p_customer_id, p_seller_id);

		-- adding into order list
		INSERT INTO order_items(order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity, price_per_unit, total_order_value)
		VALUES
		(p_order_item_id, p_order_id, p_product_id, p_quantity, v_price, v_price*p_quantity);

		--updating inventory
		UPDATE inventory
		SET stock = stock - p_quantity
		WHERE product_id = p_product_id;
		
		RAISE NOTICE 'Thank you product: % sale has been added also inventory stock updates',v_product; 

	ELSE
		RAISE NOTICE 'Thank you for for your info the product: % is not available', v_product;

	END IF;

END; 
$$

```

## **Conclusion**

This advanced SQL project successfully demonstrates my ability to solve real-world e-commerce problems using structured queries. From improving customer retention to optimizing inventory and logistics, the project provides valuable insights into operational challenges and solutions.

By completing this project, I have gained a deeper understanding of how SQL can be used to tackle complex data problems and drive business decision-making.
